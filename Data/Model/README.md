# Model README

This document serves as a guide for interpreting the various files and folders in the Model folder. It Contains our models, from scratch and with TensorFlow.


## File Definitions:

- **model_from_scratch.ipynb**: Contains functions (e.g. leaky_relu) and classes (e.g. Layer) to create a feedforward neural network using Numpy. Contains a model built with these “from-scratch” NN tools and a model with the same architecture built with TensorFlow.

- **(old - initial run) TF Models for Data Comparison**: Contains 12 different models with the same architecture to compare the performance of models trained on different feature sets.

- **TF Models for Data Comparison**: Contains 15 different models with the same architecture to compare the performance of models trained on different feature sets.


## Folder Definitions:

- **train_test_split_data**: Contains the data used to train and validate the models in *TF Models for Data Comparison.ipynb* so other models can be trained on the exact same train-test split if necessary.
