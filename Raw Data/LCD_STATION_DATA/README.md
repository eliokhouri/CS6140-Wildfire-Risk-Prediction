# Local Climatological Data (LCD) README

This document serves as a guide for interpreting the various files and folders in the Local Climatological Data (LCD) LCD_STATION_DATA folder.


## File Definitions:


- **Data_mining_notebook_LCD.ipynb**: All the python scripts used to retrieve, mine, process, modify and convert this data from raw data to the final product. 

The files below serve as inventory files, our raw data folder contain files with measurements, our scripts use these inventory files to find station ids, locations and elevations so that we can target the appropriate raw data file (i.e. the station closest to our wildfire incident).

- **LCD_ALL_STATIONS_ALL_INFO.csv**: Comprehensive list of all 151 stations with name, location and elevation included.

- **LCD_MY_STATIONS_ALL_INFO.csv**: Comprehensive list of the 139 relevant stations with name, location and elevation included. From the 151 stations, we drop down to 139 due to time constraints where certain stations do not have recent measurements.

- **LCD_MY_STATION_DIFFERENCES.csv**: Log of the stations we drop from the 151 stations to the 139 due to time constraints where certain stations do not have recent measurements.


## Folder Definitions:

- **Raw_data_download_mod**: This folder contains all the 139 stations that record weather measurements in conjunction with the dates of our fire data, in other words around 10 stations were dropped due to no a lack of recording up to the present day. Raw data files were also modified through feature selection, and feature engineering on the dates and station ids (dates were split into year, month, day, hour, minute and ids were stripped from the extended station identification column).  

- **Raw_data_download_mod_preprocessed**: This folder contains all the 139 stations, processed from the `Raw_data_download_mod` folder. It includes preprocessing steps to remove mixed data types.

- **Raw_data_download_mod_preprocessed_converted**: This folder contains all the 139 stations, processed from the `Raw_data_download_mod_preprocessed ` folder. It includes conversion steps to transform the hourly and sub-hourly intervals to daily intervals. This processing generates additional features such as mean, mode, min, max, etc., for more comprehensive analysis.
